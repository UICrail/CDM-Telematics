The Wiki contents can be packed into a markdown by a script. The action can be triggered manually (see "Actions" menu). It is triggered automatically:
* When a wikipage gets created, updated, or deleted
* When an image in /Graphol/diagrams/ gets created, updated, or deleted

The output consists of following files:
* A standalone file with embedded images: please disregard, as some images are not properly "inserted" and displayed.
* A standalone file with images in a subfolder: can be viewed in Typora, but trouble with Obsidian.

The file generation may take up to one minute.

Important: **the authoritative source is the Wiki**, and the transformation is one-way!
