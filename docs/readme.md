The Wiki contents can be packed into a markdown by a script. The action can be triggered manually (see "Actions" menu). It is triggered automatically:
* When a wikipage gets created, updated, or deleted
* When an image in /Graphol/diagrams/ gets created, updated, or deleted

The output consists of two files:
* A standalone file with embedded images
* A standalone file with images in a subfolder

The file generation may take up to one minute.

Important: **the authoritative source is the Wiki**, and the transformation is one-way!
