# CDM-Telematics
Re-engineering the Telematics TSI ontology, with FP5 demonstrator application in mind.

The challenge is to refer to Telematics TSI concepts and concept schemes (as published by ERA in the TAF XSD, Telematics ontology and associated concept schemes) to the largest extent possible, while making the present ontology suitable for use in combination with other ontologies, in the context of the CDM (Conceptual Data Model) developed by FP1 MOTIONAL (Work Package 30).

The latest version of the "Revisited telematics" ontology can be found in the Ontologies folder as well as [here, as an RDF-Turtle file](http://cdm.ovh/taf/tafp5.ttl).

Extensive documentation can be found in the Wiki. The Wiki pages are automatically compiled into markdown, LaTeX, and pdf documents to be found under /docs.
